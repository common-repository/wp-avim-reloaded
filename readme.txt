== Description ==

*Why -Reloaded?*

WP-AVIM was written by [Quang Anh Do](http://onetruebrace.com/ quanganhdo).
He used the procedural version of AVIM, I prefer the object-oriented version so I made the -Reloaded version with many improvements

*What is AVIM?*

It is a JavaScript file that you can include in your HTML files to allow your visitors who use a supported browser to type Vietnamese without any additional software installed on their computer. AVIM was written by [Hieu Tran Dang](http://sourceforge.net/projects/rhos AVIM's homepage).

*What is WP-AVIM-Reloaded?*

A Quick AVIM-Reloaded Integration into your WordPress powered blog.
AVIM-Reloaded is an improvement of object-oriented AVIM, object-oriented version is designed to avoid javascript function collision.
This javascript was compressed with YUI Compressor 2.4.2, it's safe with gzip transfering.
